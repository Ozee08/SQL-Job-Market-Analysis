# Job Market Insights SQL Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **job market dynamics** using SQL.  
We simulate a relational database containing companies, job postings, required skills, and applicants.  
Through structured SQL queries, we uncover insights about **industries, skills demand, salaries, and applicant behavior**.  

The project is designed as a **portfolio-ready case study** to showcase SQL proficiency, data analysis, and database design.

## 🗂️ Database Schema  

The database consists of **5 tables**:  

- **Company** → Information about employers (industry, location).  
- **Job_Posting** → Job details (title, type, salary, posting date).  
- **Skill** → Core skills (SQL, Python, etc.).  
- **Job_Skill** → Bridge table mapping jobs to required skills.  
- **Applicant** → Candidates applying for jobs.

# Key SQL Queries & Insights
## 1. Top industries by job postings
```sql
SELECT c.industry, COUNT(*) AS job_count
FROM company c
JOIN job_posting j ON c.company_id = j.company_id
GROUP BY c.industry
ORDER BY job_count DESC;
